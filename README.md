### Derivatives pricing functions in Julia

This is primarily an exercise for me, working through Mark Joshi's 
book *C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives pricing*.  I realize that
Julia is a very different language, but I hope to gain a couple things:
* An applied understanding of basic asset pricing models.
* Exposure to the differences in design between the two languages.
